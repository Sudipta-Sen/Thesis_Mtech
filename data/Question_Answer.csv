India's Unpredictability,Indian Tourism ,"[""India tosses up the unexpected. This can be challenging, particularly for the first-time visitor: the poverty is confronting, Indian bureaucracy can be exasperating and the crush of humanity may turn the simplest task into a frazzling epic. Even veteran travellers find their nerves frayed at some point; yet this is all part of the India ride. With an ability to inspire, frustrate, thrill and confound all at once, adopting a 'go with the flow' attitude is wise if you wish to retain your sanity. Love it or loathe it – and most travellers see-saw between the two - to embrace India's unpredictability is to embrace its soul.""]"
Taj Mahal,Indian Tourism ,"[""Exquisite tomb that's as much a monument to love as it is to death, the Taj Mahal is arguably the world's most beautiful building, and has been enshrined in the writings of Tagore and Kipling. Built by Emperor Shah Jahan in adoration of his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, this milky-white marble mausoleum is inlaid with calligraphy, precious and semiprecious stones and intricate floral designs representing eternal paradise, and is the pinnacle of Mughal architecture as well as romance.""]"
Otherworldly Hampi,Indian Tourism ,"[""Magnificent, even in ruins, Hampi was once the cosmopolitan Vijayanagar, capital of a powerful Hindu empire, spread across an emerald-green and terracotta-red landscape. Its temples and royal structures combine sublimely with the terrain: giant rocks balance on slender pedestals near an ancient elephant garage; temples tuck into crevices between boulders; and wicker coracles float by rice paddies and bathing buffalo near a gargantuan bathtub for a former queen. As the sunset casts a rosy glow over the dreamy landscape, you might just forget what planet you’re on.""]"
Ladakh: A Spiritual Journey in the Shadow of the Himalaya,Indian Tourism ,"[""As you head north, the air grows cooler and crisper, and you reach quaint, historic hill stations, summer escapes that are ringed by snow-capped peaks. In Ladakh cultural influences came via mountain passes. Tibetan Buddhism thrives, and multilayered monasteries emerge from the forest or steep cliffs as vividly and poetically as the sun rises over Khangchendzonga. Weathered prayer flags flutter in the wind, the soothing sound of monks chanting reverberates in meditation halls, and locals abound with holy offerings, all in the shadow of the mighty Himalaya.""]"
Caves of Ajanta,Indian Tourism ,"[""They may have been ascetics, but the 2nd-century-BC monks who created the Ajanta caves certainly had an eye for the dramatic. The 30 rock-cut forest grottoes punctuate the side of a horseshoe-shaped cliff, and originally had individual staircases leading down to the river. The architecture and towering stupas made these caves inspiring places to meditate and live, but the real bling came centuries later, in the form of exquisite carvings and paintings depicting the Buddha’s former lives. Renunciation of the worldly life was never so serenely sophisticated.""]"
The Sacred and Spiritual City of Varanasi,Indian Tourism ,"[""Welcome to Varanasi, a city full of life and death, and one of India's most revered sacred cities. Pilgrims flock here to worship, take a holy dip in the Ganges River, or cremate loved ones. Hindus believe the waters of the Ganges cleanse away sins, while dying here is deemed particularly propitious as it offers emancipation from the arduous life-and-death cycle. Varanasi will swiftly sweep you into its dizzying spiritual whirlwind – just take a deep breath and immerse yourself in pondering the meaning of life, death…and beyond.""]"
Exploring Delhi's Rich History and Culture,Indian Tourism ,"[""India's capital bears the mighty remnants of former empires, from great Mughal tombs to grandiose British-era mansions. There's so much to see here: the crumbling splendour of Old Delhi – with the Jama Masjid, Red Fort and its havelis (ornately decorated residences), the ancient forts of Tughlaqabad and Purana Qila, and the wonders of Qutb Minar and Mehrauli Archaeological Park. Add to this the city's many fine eateries, with offerings from street food to modern Indian, superb museums and amazing shopping, and it's easy to see why Delhi mesmerises many.""]"
Amritsar's Golden Temple,Indian Tourism ,"[""The Golden Temple in Amritsar, is the Sikhs' holiest of shrines, and has a magical atmosphere. Seeming to float atop a glistening pool named for the 'nectar of immortality', the temple is truly golden (the lotus-shaped dome is gilded in the real thing). Even when crowded with pilgrims it has a graceful tranquillity, with the sounds of kirtan (Sikh devotional singing) and birds chirping outside, and the mirror-like sacred pool that surrounds it.""]"
"The Mighty Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur, Rajasthan",Indian Tourism ,"[""India has many inconceivably magnificent fortresses, but Jodhpur's Mehrangarh is among the finest, rearing up from its rocky outcrop. Like others, its huge doorways were built to accommodate elephants and its entryways designed to confuse invaders, but this is one of the most imposing settings of them all (though there's a lot of competition). India's forts typically tower above their surroundings like fantastical story-book visions, but Mehrangarh has the added glory of mesmerising views down to Jodhpur, Rajasthan's magical-looking blue city.""]"
India's Rich History through its Ancient Ruins,Indian Tourism ,"[""You can wander back through time throughout India, with the legacy of countless cultures and empires scattered across cities and countryside: you don't get to be a 5000-year-old civilisation without having lots of these around. Hampi Rosy-hued temples and palaces of the mighty capital of Vijayanagar are scattered among otherworldly looking boulders and hilltops. Mandu Many of the tombs, palaces, monuments and mosques on Mandu's 20-sq-km green plateau are among India's finest Afghan architecture. Nalanda This Unesco-listed, 1600-year-old university once enrolled 10,000 monks and students. Its monasteries, temples and stupas are still elegant in ruins. Delhi Conquered and built up repeatedly over the past 3000 years, Delhi is packed full of the monumental ruins of ancient powerhouses. Fatehpur Sikri A ghostly abandoned Mughal city, close to Agra and the Taj Mahal. Maharashtra Magnificent rock-cut Buddhist temple caves.""]"
City Sophistication,Indian Tourism ,"[""City Sophistication India's cities are a world away from life in small towns or the countryside. With booming economies and millennia of sophistication under their belts, India’s cities have vibrant arts scenes, excellent restaurants and heaps of style. Mumbai Home of Bollywood, Mumbai has it all: fashion, film stars, fine dining, glamorous bars and (along with Delhi) the country's best art galleries. Delhi Urban sophisticate Delhi is famous for its cultural life, with regular festivals, plus exceptional shopping, museums, street food and swish restaurants. Kolkata (Calcutta) Renowned for its poetry and poetics, Kolkata also has fabulous colonial-era architecture and a lively arts scene. Bengaluru (Bangalore) This IT hub has a boozy nightlife with microbreweries, gastropubs and rock bars full of locals looking to party. Chennai (Madras) Towering temples, elegant bars, swish hotels, fabulous shopping and a booming restaurant scene.""]"
Festivals and Events in January,Indian Tourism ,"[""Post-monsoon cool lingers throughout the country, with downright cold in the mountains. Pleasant weather and several festivals make it a popular time to travel (book ahead!), while Delhi hosts big Republic Day celebrations. Festivals in January are Free India, Kite Festival, Southern Harvest, Pilgrimage. Free India- Republic Day commemorates the founding of the Republic of India on 26 January 1950; the biggest celebrations are in Delhi, which holds a huge military parade along Rajpath, and the Beating of the Retreat ceremony three days later. There are pigeon races in Old Delhi. Kite Festival - Sankranti, the Hindu festival marking the sun's passage into Capricorn, takes place on either 14 or 15 January, and is celebrated in many ways across India - from banana-giving to cockfights. But it's the mass kite-flying in Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra that's most spectacular. Southern Harvest - The Tamil festival of Pongal, equivalent to Sankranti, marks the end of the harvest season. Families prepare pots of pongal (a mixture of rice, sugar, dhal and milk), symbolic of prosperity and abundance, then feed them to decorated and adorned cows. Pilgrimage - The huge Hindu pilgrimage, Kumbh Mela, takes place every three years, rotating between four different locations. All involve mass devotion - mass as in tens of millions of people.""]"
February Festivals in India,Indian Tourism ,"[""This is a good time to be in India, with balmy weather in most non-mountainous areas. It's still peak travel season; sunbathing and skiing are still on. Festivals in February are Saraswati puja (Vasant Panchami), Tibetan New Year, Skiing the Northern Slopes, Shivaratri, Taj Mahotsav, Snowboarding in Gulmarg. Celebrating Saraswati - On Vasant Panchami, Hindus dress in yellow and place books, musical instruments and other educational objects in front of idols of Saraswati, the goddess of learning, to receive her blessing. The holiday sometimes falls in February. Tibetan New Year - Losar is celebrated by Tantric Buddhists all over India - particularly in Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Ladakh and Zanskar - for 15 days. Losar is usually in February or March, though dates can vary between regions. Skiing the Northern Slopes - Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand have some fine skiing and snowboarding for all levels. Snow season tends to be January to March; February's a safe bet. Shivaratri - This day of Hindu fasting recalls the tandava (cosmic victory dance) of Lord Shiva. Temple processions are followed by the chanting of mantras and anointing of linga (phallic images of Shiva). Shivaratri can also fall in March. Taj Mahotsav - This 10-day carnival of culture, cuisine and crafts is Agra's biggest and best party. Held at Shilpgram, the festival features more than 400 artisans from all over India, a potpourri of folk and classical music, and dances from various regions and enough regional food to induce a curry coma. Snowboarding in Gulmarg, Kashmir - Snowboarding in Gulmarg was an exceptional experience. When those mountains are hit by heavy snowfall, it must be a dream for backcountry skiing and freeride snowboarding. Endless uncombed tracks are running down from the top at 4,400 meters to the village nearly 2 kilometers below.""]"
March Festivals in India,Indian Tourism ,"[""The last month of the travel season, March is full-on hot in most of the country, with rains starting in the northeast. Wildlife is easier to spot as animals come out to find water. Festivals in January are Holi, Rama's Birthday, Mahavir's Birthday. Holi - One of North India's most ecstatic festivals; Hindus celebrate the beginning of spring according to the lunar calendar, in February or March, by throwing coloured water and gulal (powder) at anyone within range. Bonfires the night before symbolise the demise of demoness Holika. Wildlife-Watching - When the weather warms up, water sources dry out and animals venture into the open to find refreshment: your chance to spot elephants, deer and, if you're lucky, tigers and leopards. Visit www.sanctuaryasia.com for detailed info. Rama's Birthday - During Rama Navami, which lasts anywhere from one to nine days, Hindus celebrate Rama's birth with processions, music, fasting and feasting, enactments of scenes from the Ramayana and, at some temples, ceremonial weddings of Rama and Sita idols. Mahavir's Birthday - Mahavir Jayanti commemorates the birth of Jainism, most important tirthankar (teacher and enlightened being). Temples are decorated and visited, Mahavir statues are given ritual baths, processions are held and offerings are given to the poor.""]"
May Festivals in India,Indian Tourism ,"[""It's hot almost everywhere. Really hot. Festivals take a back seat as humidity builds up, awaiting the release of the rain. Hill stations are hopping, though, and in the mountains it's pre-monsoon trekking season. Festivals in May are Buddha's Birthday, Ramadan, Northern Trekking. Buddha's Birthday - The celebration of Buddha's birth, nirvana (enlightenment) and parinirvana (total liberation from the cycle of existence, or passing away), Buddha Jayanti is quiet but moving: devotees dress simply, eat vegetarian food, listen to dharma talks and visit monasteries or temples. Ramadan (Ramazan) - Thirty days of dawn-to-dusk fasting mark the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. Muslims traditionally turn their attention to God, with a focus on prayer and purification. Northern Trekking - May and June, the months preceding the rains in the northern mountains, are good times for trekking, with sunshine and temperate weather. Consider Himachal Pradesh, Kashmir (but not Ladakh) and Uttarakhand. Mango Madness - Mangoes are indigenous to India, which is why they’re so ridiculously good here. The season starts in March; in May the fruit is sweet, juicy and everywhere.""]"
June Travel in India,Indian Tourism ,"[""June is low, low season for travellers in India on account of the heat, but a good time to trek up north. The rainy season, or pre-monsoon extreme heat, has started just about everywhere else. Festivals in June are Eid al-Fitr. Eid al-Fitr - Muslims celebrate the end of Ramadan with three days of festivities. Prayers, shopping, gift-giving and, for women and girls, mehndi (henna designs) may all be part of the celebrations.  Lunar Calendar - Many festivals follow the Indian lunar calendar (a complex system based on astrology) or the Islamic calendar (which falls about 11 days earlier each year), and therefore change annually relative to the Gregorian calendar. Contact local tourist offices for festival dates.""]"
